# Heretics SF 2030 Goals

An overarching direction of this project is, perhaps, to follow the guidance in Jorge Luis Borges' very short story "On Exactitude in Science" which describes an imaginary empire where the map is larger than the territory. See:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science
* http://languagescraps.blogspot.com/2008/09/borges-short-story-relating-to-foucault.html

This project if ever finished would be too large and too out of date to be useful. At the same time it may well provide a framework for tackling selected and specific aspects living, working and managing a facility such as ours. So, dear reader, get ready to bite your tongue, gird your loins and roll your eyes.

***

Here are 21 goals for the Heritage on the Marina to achieve by 2030.

These goals, targets and metrics follow the logic and pattern established in the [The 17 Goals]( https://sdgs.un.org/goals ) developed by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. Fingers crossed we can do the same.

The goals are divided into a [trichotomy]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotomy_(philosophy) ) of seven goals each. The trichotomy headings are location, person & organization or knowing, being & doing.

The targets and metrics of the goals are defined as one would define a [Bill of Materials]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials ) or [Bill of Quantities]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_quantities ) - exhaustive documents that where every material, part and labor-component is itemized.

Each trichotomy is further divided into seven goals. Each trichotomy includes goals that refer to the "beauty" and the "security or sustainability" of the goals in that section. They exist in order to indicate that best and the worst aspects of the other goals may require extra effort or thought in order to surpass merely meeting or satisfying the conditions of the other goals.
